New in 2.2.0: RMWC Addons!

While the primary goal of wrapping material-components-web remains the same, they simply don't currently (or aren't planning on) supporting the entire spec. New functionality:

- Circular Progress
- Icon Sizing
- Data Tables

New in 2.0.0: Individually packaged and released components!

2.0.0 does not contain any changes to the components themselves, but it's a major refactor of how RMWC is packaged and deployed. All components have been broken apart into their own npm packages. What this means for you:

- From now on RMWC will honor Semver. Any breaking change to a component (aka prop interface) will bump the major version. This should alleviate some issues people have had with npm greedily auto updating.
- Components can now be individually installed which means they can also be individually upgraded. This further alleviates the pain of a breaking changes by allowing you to upgrade one component at a time at your leisure. 
- Please note that all components will still be versioned and released to together. This means that if any component has a breaking change, the version will be bumped on ALL components, even though they don't contain a breaking change. This is the safest way to guarantee cohesive releases of the library. You'll know that all 3.x.x components are intended to work together.
- The docs have been updated to reflect importing from the new modules, but work has been done to make sure importing from the old syntax (rmwc/Button) still works for the time being. It is recommended that you upgrade to the new syntax at your convenience (@rmwc/button).

## Goals

* To create the thinnest, lightest, and spec compliant wrapper around Google
  Material Design Components for the Web
  [https://material.io/components/web/](https://material.io/components/web/)
* To utilize the Foundation javascript classes and expose their api for
  consumption
* To be as unobtrusive and sensible as possible.
* To fill the gaps in material-components-web with custom React community driven components.

## Installation

Required steps

* `npm i rmwc --save` or `yarn add rmwc`
* [material-components-web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) should be installed automatically as a peer dependency. Include `node_modules/material-components-web/dist/material-components-web.min.css` in your project via your method of choice (using a link tag, a css-loader, etc.).

Optional steps

* If you would like to use the default **Roboto font**:
  * add `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500" rel="stylesheet" />`
  * add the class `mdc-typography` to the body `<body className="mdc-typography">...</body>`
* If you would like to use the **material-icons** font:
  * add `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel="stylesheet">`
* Add global settings by using the optional `<RMWCProvider />` component at the root of your project. See the 'Provider' section for more info.
* Add the class `mdc-theme--background` to the `<body>`
